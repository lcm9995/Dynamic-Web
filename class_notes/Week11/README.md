## HW - Final Project Proposal Presentations Next Tuesday!

It's Week11. Your final project presentations are Week14. You have a lot of new topics to incorporate like Context and data persistence with an API and Database.In the next few weeks we will be delving into the world of Redux.

One option, is to take our bare bones `Todo List App` and reskin it as something more specific. This would obviously include styling but more importantly, adding more input fields to make the usage of your app more specific. For example: you could turn the generic todo list into an exercise tracker. Maybe you add some color coding, or a way to filter or search existing todos. If you choose this option, you MUST add new fields! A simple styling pass will not suffice.

The other option is to build a new tool, game, or site that utilizes at least 2 topics from the second half of the semester. This option is more open, but make sure you dedmonstrate working knowledge of Context, JSON Server, and/or Redux! If you are unsure about your topic, feel free to reach out.

## Presentation Slides

- concept|theme of the site (not just random images and links that show skill)
  an existing website you drew inspiration from (bonus points for Pinterest
  collection or mood board)
- concepts|skills we have covered that you will use to build your site
- concepts|skills you need to still learn to complete the project

Look familiar? Yup! Lets get the ball rolling for our final projects and get the concepts and planning out of the way. This will set you up to have a much clearer idea of what you are building and a plan of attack before you begin to code. Suggestion: When you do begin stubbing out your project, think about file/folder organization. If the question pops into your head, "Should I break this out into their own separate files?", the answer is usually YES! Organize and comment yout project in a way that another developer could easily jump in and contribute to the project without an in person code tour by you.
